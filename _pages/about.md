I am currently a master student in [Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). I am in [Intelligent mobile-manipulation (IM^2) lab](https://imsquared.github.io/) directed by [Beomjoon Kim](https://beomjoonkim.github.io/).

I am interested in all the things related to intelligent movement of the robot arm including reinforcement learning, sim-to-real, robot hardware design, and perception algorithm.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree double majoring in mechanical engineering and computer science engineering from [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr/).
